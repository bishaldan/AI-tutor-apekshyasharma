It whooshed through the stars, past twinkling lights.  Zip waved at a friendly shooting star!\n\nOn the moon, Zip bounced!  He bounced and bounced and bounced! The moon was made of cheese, or so it seemed!  It was so much fun!\n\nThen, it was time to go home. Zoom's rocket zipped back to Earth.  Zip waved goodbye to the moon and his cheesy adventure."
